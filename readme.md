# Advent of Code 2022

### Usage
Add days with `./add_day.sh 1` where 1 is day to add.

This will add a src file for the day and add a match statement
in `main.rs` so You can easaly run the day with `cargo run 1` 
and tests with `cargo test day1`for example. 

Check `helpers.rs` for some utilitys for reading files to vectors and such.

**Happy coding!**
